                <p>The Spinal Flow technique is gentle, non invasive therapy designed to restore
                    balance and harmony to your body by:
                    Promoting Spinal Health: Ensuring you spine is aligned and free of blockages, crucial for overall
                    well-being
                    Enhancing Energy Flow: Using light touch and pressure to stimulate the flow of cerebrospinal
                    fluidand release tension.
                    Reducing Stress: Alleviating symptoms of stress and anxiety through relaxation and tension release.
                    Personalised Treatment: Tailoring session to meet your unique needs for optimal results.
                    The body is an intricate interconnected system, by focusing on the spine we aim to address
                    imbalances and support the body‚Äôs natural healing processes. During Spinal Flow session,
                    practitioner use gentle techniques to help you achieve a state of relaxation and well-being. Spinal
                    blockages are seen as disruptions in the flow of energy and information through the system. These
                    blockages act like static interference, preventing the body‚Äôs natural ability to heal itself.
                    Spinal Flow Practitioner uses 33 specific accesss points located primarily on the sacrum and
                    cranium.
                    These points are where the dura mater, a protective layer around the spinal cord, is closest to the
                    surface of the skin. By gently contacting these access points, Practitioner send signals to the
                    brain to release the bloc cages. Process helps to restore the natural flow of energy and information
                    through the spine and nervous system. Releasing spinal blockages can lead to significant
                    improvements in various symptoms , including pain, depression, anxiety, headaches, fibromyalgia and
                    chronic fatigue. Technique aims to restore the body‚Äôs natural state of ease and balance,
                    facilitating overall healing and well-being.</p>

            <p>Spinal Flow technique utilises the concept of the seven gateways of the spine as a
                primary assessment tool to understand and address various health issues. Each gateway corresponds to

                experiences related to stress and trauma. By working with these gateways, Practitioner can help release
